# QB2023_Stoltz Madison Stoltz mmstoltz@iu.edu 
# I am a first year in EEB in the Reynolds lab. I recently graduated from UIUC with my BS in Integrative Biology and a minor in natural resource conservation. My primary research interests are urban ecology, climate change, and plant-soil interactions. One thing people may not know about me is that I have a ten year old cat named Patches. 
# Course expectations: 
#1. To understand the steps I am taking, rather than going along with things I do not understand.
#2. Similarly, to ask questions and collaborate with others when necessary.
#3. By the end of this course, feel comfortable performing tasks on my own.
